# Inhuman Benchmark

A collection of scripts to break the limits of the [Human Benchmark tests](https://humanbenchmark.com/)

- Reaction speed: 1ms (inconsistent)
- Aim Trainer: 1ms (consistent)
- Typing Speed: 36,180 wpm (maximum over ~10 tries)
- Chimp Test: Level 41 (max level, but maybe it can be done faster)
- Verbal Memory: you really can't lose, but it can go faster

Can you do better or be more consistent? Please let me know!
